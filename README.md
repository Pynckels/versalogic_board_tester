# Data620 Testing Device - Project Overview

The Data620 computer is a unique and fascinating machine built using analog electronic circuitry. It employs a versalogic signaling scheme where a logical **false** or bit value **0** is represented by **0V**, while a logical **true** or bit value **1** is represented by **-12V**. This unconventional voltage scheme sets it apart from many modern digital systems.

Constructed from basic electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors, the Data620â€™s entire system is divided into a large number of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Each PCB contains analog circuitry, and it is known that some of these boards may include faulty or erroneous components.

Currently, there is no dedicated testing device available to verify the functionality of these PCBs. Such a device would be highly valuable to anyone restoring or working with the Data620, as it would allow for systematic troubleshooting and repair.

This project represents the first draft towards developing such a testing device. It includes preliminary hardware design concepts and the necessary SPICE simulations to understand and verify the circuitry. However, at this stage, only the hardware draft exists.

Software development for this testing device is in its early stages and will proceed following the completion of a stable hardware version. It also awaits the reverse engineering efforts of the DATA620 PCBs carried out by third parties.

This project is currently an independent effort (not affiliated with Usagi Electric or other existing Data620 projects). We hold great respect for the significant contributions and extensive work carried out by Usagi Electric and the dedicated volunteers contributing to the Usagi Electric Data620 project. Our development is separate, however, we are more than willing to explore opportunities to collaborate and join forces in the future.

As this is an initial draft, the design undoubtedly contains errors and inaccuracies. We warmly welcome constructive feedback and suggestions from the community to improve and refine the project.
