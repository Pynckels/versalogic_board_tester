 *
 * Description:
 *   This program controls the board tester hardware by interfacing with
 *   the shift buffers to maximize testing flexibility. Its logic includes:
 *     1. Reading floating pins (bits 4..40) to detect the inserted board type.
 *     2. Determining the board type using a "winner takes all" algorithm.
 *     3. Setting the direction of board pins according to the detected board.
 *     4. Looping through test scenarios: outputting TTL signals and verifying
 *        corresponding inputs.
 *
 *   UART communication is via TTL (5V/0V), and frequent reprogramming may
 *   require a ZIF socket.
