 * Description:
 *   This program tests two cascaded 74xx165 IC's and the Cascaded_74xx165
 *   class by shifting serial data out of the last 74xx165. The parallel input
 *   is set with jumper wires on the breadboard. The serial output is visualized
 *   by this program.
 *
 *   UART communication goes via an USB-B cable.
